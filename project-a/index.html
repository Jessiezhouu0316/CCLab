                <ul>
                    <li>Mood swings constantly.
</li>
                    <li>Vulnerable to human approaches.</li>
                    <li>Forms symbiotic relationships with other digital terrains.
</li>
                    <li>Never repeats itself — each individual is unique.

                Mosselini is a fictional moss-like organism inspired by fragile ecosystems. It combines natural floating movement with reactive behavior, giving a sense of vulnerability and mood. Observations suggest it thrives best in environments with minimal disturbance, and it reacts instantly to approaching entities by maintaining a safe distance. Its changing colors are not just aesthetic but represent its “emotional” state.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Approach slowly: sudden movements cause the moss to retreat.
</li>
                    <li>Observe without touching: it will darken and slow down if stressed.</li>
                    <li>Let it drift freely: enjoy the changing colors and shapes as it flows naturally.
</li>
    
                </ul>
